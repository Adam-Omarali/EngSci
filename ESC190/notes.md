### Interpreted vs Compiled Languages

Python is an interpreted language, meaning writing python file.py runs a script itself that executes code block by block

Machine Code $\rightarrow$ Moving and writing data to memory addresses

A compiler takes hunan-readable code and translates it to machine code.
The lower level language, the easiar it is to translate into machine code. The less abstraction it has. Ex - For loops and functions are an abstraction.

C for loops include more detail to make it less abstract

Typical workflow for high level CS:
- Write in Python
- Figure out the ineffecient part of the program
- Write that part in C
